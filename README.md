# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis | Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship
## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment trends in Twitter data to uncover public opinions and reactions toward various entities or topics. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project categorizes tweets into distinct sentiment classes: positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant.

## 📊 Dataset
The analysis uses a labeled dataset of tweets containing information about sentiments toward different entities. The dataset includes the following columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each tweet.
Entity: The topic or brand mentioned in the tweet.
Sentiments: The sentiment label (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).
Contest: The actual content of the tweet.
## 🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
### To run this analysis, install the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

## 📂 Repository Contents
Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data processing, sentiment distribution analysis, and visualizations.
data/twitter_training.csv: The dataset used for the sentiment analysis.
## 🔑 Key Insights
### Sentiment Distribution:

Negative Tweets: Most prevalent sentiment category.
Positive Tweets: A close second in volume.
Neutral Tweets: Showed substantial presence.
Irrelevant Tweets: Comprising the smallest share.
### Entity Analysis:

Specific brands or topics like "Microsoft" displayed a mix of Neutral, Negative, and Positive sentiments, with Neutral being dominant.
### Visualizations:

Sentiment distributions and entity-specific sentiment trends were illustrated using bar charts and pie charts for easy interpretation.
## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
Implement advanced NLP models for sentiment classification, such as transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).
Expand the analysis to include trending hashtags or topics.
Incorporate interactive visualizations for dynamic analysis.
## 📈 Applications
Analyzing brand reputation on social media.
Understanding public opinion during events or crises.
Enhancing marketing strategies based on sentiment trends.
